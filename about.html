<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>🧑‍💻Hello! My name is P. Bhawna, and I’m currently a 3rd-year B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science.</p>

<p>I’m deeply passionate about technology and continuous learning, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence, modern tech tools, and software development. With AI transforming the tech landscape rapidly, I’m actively exploring and learning new AI tools that are shaping the future — and I aspire to integrate them meaningfully into real-world applications.</p>

<p>Alongside my technical interests, I also enjoy creative storytelling and singing, which allow me to express myself and keep a balanced mindset.
